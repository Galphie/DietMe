# DietMe

DietMe is an end-of-degree project, as a support application for a hypothetical dietician's clinic. 


It has a double function: on the one hand, it aims to facilitate the management of patients by the dietician 
(making appointments, seeing data on a specific patient, communicating with him/her, etc.), 
as well as serving as a tool for making calculations specific to his/her profession; 
on the other hand, so that the patient himself/herself has access to his/her data 
(diets, tips, graphs to see his/her evolution, etc.) and can make an appointment and communicate with the dietician.
